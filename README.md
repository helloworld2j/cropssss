# Crop Yield Prediction and Crop Recommendation System

## Introduction
This repository contains code for a Crop Yield Prediction and Crop Recommendation System using various machine learning algorithms. The system aims to predict the yield of different crops based on environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, pH level, and rainfall. Additionally, it provides recommendations for suitable crops based on these factors.

## this is a working model 


## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes information about various crops and their corresponding environmental conditions. It consists of the following features:
- N (Nitrogen content)
- P (Phosphorous content)
- K (Potassium content)
- Temperature
- Humidity
- pH level
- Rainfall
- Crop (Target variable)

## Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering: Adding a new column "Yield" indicating production per unit area

## Machine Learning Algorithms Used:
1. Linear Regression
2. Random Forest
3. Support Vector Regression (SVR)
4. Decision Tree

## Model Evaluation
- Evaluation metrics: R-squared score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Cross-validation to assess model performance

## Hyperparameter Tuning
- GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV used for hyperparameter tuning

## Visualization
- Pairplot for visualizing features
- Bar plots for visualizing the relationship between crops and environmental factors
- Heatmap for correlation analysis
